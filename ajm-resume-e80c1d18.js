            <p>
              I create the environments that identify, develop, and sustain
              teams that create some of the world's most amazing
              software.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've spent my career contemplating everything from operating
              system design to fully modeled virtual worlds to essential
              questions about data, but it always comes back to one fundamental
              thing: are we building software experiences that make our users'
              lives better? To me, that is the reward behind everything I do.

              <p>
                As CTO, I am Infotech's technical thought leader for both our
                proprietary products division and AASHTOWare Project. I am tasked
                with communicating the history, current state, and future state of
                all products. I support our product experts to make strategic
                decisions for integrations based on our goals and technical
                feasibility. I evangelize our advancement of the technology and
                integrations of our current solutions so we can scale and meet our
                key business objectives.
              </p>
              <p>
                And so I never become disconnected from the craft, I also create
                prototypes and proofs-of-concept to demonstrate new ideas and
                communicate them more effectively.

              <p>
                I led Infotech's proprietary software products division.
                To do so, it was essential to create an environment where each
                and every member of the division feels motivated and engaged,
                where they know and believe in their role in achieving our
                shared goals, and have room to perfect their crafts.
              </p>
              <p>
                This extends beyond the product division. Developing and
                growing partnerships with those who rely on the successful
                execution of our strategy means the difference between success
                and fading into obscurity. Technical excellence is table stakes
                for me, but requires constant vigilance to stay on top of tech
                trends and responsibly respond with sound architecture and
                application design.
